# Tech Well

Tech Well is a challenging custom map for Animal Well fans. This map uses a lot of unused mechanics and glitches to create difficult platforming challenges.

## Install Guide

3. Paste and extract "MAXWELL.zip" in the folder where your "ANIMAL WELL.exe" is located.

## Map Info

Tech Well has 5 "Challenges" and a "Final Challenge." The Final Challenge can only be accessed with a secret flute code. This code can be deciphered by reaching the end of each challenge.

The layout of Tech Well forces the player to stay in one challenge at a time. This means that you'll have to reset your save if you want to try anotherâ€”even after reaching the end of a challenge.
The reason for this restriction is to ensure players only have specific items in each challenge. (Allowing item collection across challenges could break the mapâ€™s design).

**Don't worry though,** 
resetting your save file will not have any impact on the map, because non of the items in the challenges are required to progress the map (Only your knowledge is ðŸ˜‰).

## Happy Welling, Everyone!
